## Analysis
I propose the following revisions to Rpr-Malcomb-2014:
1. Calculate vulnerability score using a geometric aggregation rather than an additive aggregation. Replicate Figure 5 using the new vulnerability scores.

## Results
1. Figure 6 will show the distribution of geometric vulnerability scores using the same color ramp as Figure 5.  


## Discussion
1. Pixels with high vulnerabiltiy are likely to have particularly low scores in one or more catagories, even if they don't have low scores in other categories. Pixels with low vulnerability are likely to have particularly high scores in one or more categories, even if they don't have high scores in other categories. Overall, the range of values will be spread out, giving greater emphasis to the pixels with the highest and lowest amounts of vulnerability. Pixels with mid-level scores may either have mid-level scores in all categories or a mix of high and low scores that are relatively balanced.
